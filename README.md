![Level Designer Preview](https://github.com/phpn00b/wpf-mario/blob/main/game-preview.png)
This is a simple 2D side scroller based on the original NES Super Mario Brothers written in pure WPF. This is MVVMish and handles all positioning of landscaping, enemies, and mario via canvas.

Please keep in mind that this project is quick and dirty illistration of how to build a game like Mario. (full project represents about 6 hours of effort... corners were cut)

# Features:
- Hitboxes for enemies & mario as well as environmental elements.
- Full drag and drop level designer were you can position environmental elements and enemies and create a JSON level file.
- Simple physics engine. 


# Lacking:
- Currently Enemies can kill you but you can't hurt them. 
- Only Gumbas working no trutles. 
- Sometimes gumbas get confused and walk on top of you or each other.
